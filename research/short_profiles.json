You can make it with sourdough discard or active starter- it’s up to you. You’ll need about 1 cup. Once baked, the taste is slightly sweet, not too dense, and perfect with a pat of salted butter. This recipe is adapted from the lovable @inagarten. I’ve been making her famous soda bread since 2012! 💚\\n\\nIngredients:\\n\\n375 g (3 cups) all purpose flour\\n50 g (4 tbsp) granulated sugar\\n5 g (1 tsp) baking soda\\n7 g (1 1/2 tsp) fine sea salt\\n60 g (4 tbsp) unsalted butter, cold, cut into small cubes\\n1 large egg\\n170 g (appx. 3/4 cup) buttermilk\\n200 g (appx. 1 cup) sourdough starter discard or active sourdough starter\\n150 g (1 cup) raisins\\n\\nShort hand method:\\nPreheat oven to 375 F/190 C. \\nIn a stand mixer: combine dry ingredients. Add butter cubes, one at a time. Add wet ingredients. Mix to to incorporate. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface, just to bring it together (barely 1 minute). Shape into ball.

It comes from getting three simple things right.\\n\\n1. Add steam.\\nSteam helps your sourdough rise before the crust hardens. I use the double pan method or pour water into a hot tray to create steam. It completely changed my bread.\\n\\n2. Don’t underbake.\\nOnce the lid’s off, lower the oven to 400°F and bake until the crust turns a deep golden brown—about 20 to 25 minutes. It should smell rich and toasty.\\n\\n3. Cool it uncovered.\\nAlways cool your sourdough on a rack. If it sits on a pan or is covered, the trapped steam will soften the crust. Let it rest for at least an hour. It’s worth it.\\n\\nIf your sourdough crust has been soft or pale, try these three tips. They took my bread from flat and chewy to golden and crisp.\\n\\nHas your crust ever given you trouble? I’d love to hear what’s worked for you.\\n\\n📌Save this for your next bake and follow for real, beginner-friendly sourdough help that actually works.\\n\\n#sourdoughforbeginners #sourdoughcrusttips #sourdoughbakingguide #sourdoughcommunity #bakefromscratch #sourdoughstartertips #naturallyleavenedbread #realbreadmovement #homebakingmadeeasy #learnsourdough #bakersofinstagram #sourdoughmadeeasy #sourdoughhelp #sourdoughbakerlife #beginnerbreadbaking",

Use an active starter\\nMake sure your sourdough starter is bubbly and doubled before you mix.\\nPro Tip: Feed it the night before if your kitchen is cool. It’s ready when it smells sweet and slightly tangy.\\n\\n✅ 2. Rest your dough after mixing\\nMix starter, flour, water, and salt until no dry bits remain. Let it rest 45 minutes.\\nPro Tip: This rest makes the dough stronger and easier to stretch later, which helps it rise higher in the oven.\\n\\n✅ 3. Stretch and fold three times\\nEvery 30 minutes, lift and fold the dough.\\nPro Tip: This replaces kneading. You’ll feel it tighten each round, which means gluten is forming.\\n\\n✅ 4. Chill overnight for better flavor\\nShape your dough, cover it, and refrigerate overnight.\\nPro Tip: Cold proofing builds a deeper flavor and makes the dough easier to score in the morning.\\n\\n✅ 5. Bake cold and hot\\nBake the dough straight from the fridge in a 475°F (245°C) preheated Dutch oven.\\nPro Tip: The cold dough hits the hot pot and traps steam, which helps your sourdough spring and open beautifully.\\n\\nComment “bread” for my simple sourdough bread recipe. Perfect for beginners 👌🏼 \\n\\n“Make sure your following so that you receive the recipe in your inbox”\\n\\n📌Save this Reel and try it with your next bake.\\n\\n🏷️Tag me in your loaf & I’ll share a few in my stories to inspire other new bakers.\\n\\n#sourdough #sourdoughreel #sourdoughbakingforbeginners #sourdoughmadeeasy #homemadesourdoughloaf #sourdoughtips #sourdoughbakingprocess #howtobakesourdough #sourdoughlearningjourney #homemadebread #sourdoughbaking #howtomakesourdough",

But that didn’t come without my own drive, dedication, and endless work ethic. Being a first generation immigrant is no walk in the park. Growing up in Louisiana with black skin is not easy either. But the best part about living in the U.S. is that our dreams are here for the taking. The success stories can be built and they can be made if you just NEVER GIVE UP.

This is completely true from my perspective because as someone who found bulk fermenting in bigger batches so intimidating, I never thought I’d get to a point where I actually could be proud of myself for getting there. Just getting there was what I wanted so bad. So I took that as my goal and made it a mission to conquer that fear, as hard as it was because I didn’t want to fail. \\nI stayed true and focused on learning my dough - letting my dough tell me the story and not rushing the process. \\nWe put so much pressure on ourselves to master everything at once… but the truth?\\nMost of the growth happens when you focus on one small skill and repeat it until it feels natural.\\nFor me, it was bulk rise. \\nOne day at a time. One batch at a time. \\nNo rushing. No comparing. Just learning with my hands and watching the dough teach me.\\nIf you’re in that season too-where you’re trying to get “better at it all”- let this be your reminder:\\nStart with one thing. Practice it. Trust it.\\nYour progress will show up long before perfection ever does.\\nSave this for when you need to hear it again. ♥️🫶🏻🥰🍞🥖🌾#sourdoughbaking #sourdoughbread #sourdoughbaker #sourdoughfromscratch #sourdoughloaves #sourdoughjourney #bakingwithsourdough #bulkfermentation #bulkrise #coquitlambaker #microbaker",

I found a recipe that worked for me just by watching others and using their recipes as guidance and over time it began to improve, I tweaked what I felt confident enough to do for me. When you’re just beginning it gets overwhelming-you don’t need 20 formulas- just one that you can practice until it feels natural.\\n🫶🏻#2 👉🏻 A visual cheat sheet for dough readiness. I practiced this over and over so many times till I felt confident enough to know my dough. I started to look for the signs - all of them:\\n\\t•\\tSmooth top/dome shape\\n\\t•\\tPuffy sides/and pulls nicely away from your bowl when u touch it \\n\\t•\\tJiggly bowl\\n\\t•\\tLight bubbles\\nOnce you practice this step it does become alot easier to know when u are done bulk fermenting, patience is key here & trusting the process too. \\n🫶🏻#3 👉🏻 Don’t compare your loaf to someone else’s year 3. Give yourself room to learn. Your loaf will tell its own story. Everyone’s dough behaves differently… and everyone’s journey starts in a different place.\\nWhat you’re seeing online is often someone’s year 3, 4, or 5 not their first few tries. Your job right now isn’t to match their results - it’s to learn your dough, build confidence, and enjoy the process.\\n I hope this helps you at your stage of your journey - save this for future success and drop any comments below🥰🫶🏻🥖✨🍞🌾♥️#sourdoughbaking #sourdoughbaker #sourdoughbread #sourdoughfromscratch #sourdoughbreads #sourdoughloaves #sourdoughjourney #bakingwithsourdough #bakingsourdoughathome #coquitlambaker #bakingwithconfidence #slowandsteady #practicemakesperfect #comparisonisthethiefofjoy",

Just one quick feed and it’s bubbly and ready for all the vacation baking.\\n\\nAnd because it’s Thanksgiving week, yes… I’m traveling with cubed sourdough bread too.

The practice is much more important. \\n\\nI’ve been playing around with using my three loaf pans to bake tiny focaccias from one big dough. I find that about 100-150 grams of dough is just right for a loaf pan focaccia. I could see baking eight of these at once.

Shouts out to the amazing bakeries there, including @ayubakehousenola and @levee, where I had some of the best bread I’ve ever tasted. I had a baguette on a bench and felt very French. 🙂\\n\\nAs promised in my previous post, I want to share a few tips for creating breadscape gardens like these, followed by the formula I used for this dough. First, the tips:\\n\\n1) As I mentioned previously, the best base I’ve ever found for the surface of the dough is a thin layer of simple basil pesto. The flavor is wonderful and complements the vegetables, and it also helps them stick to the surface of the dough. \\n2) Don’t just lay the vegetables on top of the dough. Nestle them in there. Play around with pushing some of them in at different depths—this adds interest to the loaves once baked!\\n3) Spray your loaves with a light layer of vegetable or olive oil before baking. This is magical, because it prevents burning, minimizes shriveling, AND seems to help maintain the vibrancy of the color. This combined with the pesto on the surface of the dough envelopes the vegetables with a protective layer, and makes the bread more delicious too.\\n\\nThe veggies I used are detailed in the previous post. On to the formula. (I can’t promise I’ll use exactly the same formula next time, because I rarely do the same thing twice, but I can promise this one works!)\\n\\n400g all-purpose flour\\n50g spelt flour (if you’ve got in on hand—if not, then use what you’ve got!)\\n250g water\\n100g 100% hydration sourdough starter\\n30g melted butter\\n20g olive oil\\n50g honey\\n10g salt\\n\\nMix it all together. Let it sit for an hour or so. Give it a few folds. Let it sit more! Fold again. Do that about four times over the course of 3-4 hours. Then let it rise between 50 and 100%. \\n\\nI allow loaves to proof for about 90 minutes before topping and baking, which I do at 425f. \\n\\nHappy baking, peace n’ power to you, more to come.",

Some notes:\\n•A more acidic starter means a stronger reaction, but usually the flour in an acidic starter is more broken down leading to a less-fluffy, but more tender, result.\\n•Too much baking soda will leave a metallic taste 🤢\\n•Baking soda and baking powder are *almost* the same. Baking powder contains the acids needed for the reaction, while baking soda doesn’t. If there’s enough acid in your discard, you don’t need baking powder. 1 tsp soda = 1 tbsp powder\\n\\nNot all discard recipes use baking soda to add fluff. This is just one method out of several.\\n\\nI love to make flourless discard recipes for those who love (or need) a fully-fermented dish.

Top with your favorite toppings, cook, and enjoy!\\n•Serve it alongside your favorite dip, like hummus or chutney.\\n•Top it with mashed avocado and a fried egg. Yum!\\n•Layer on chopped, fresh greens or thinly-sliced fresh or roasted veggies.\\n\\nRecipe below, or comment “SOCCA” (Instagram only, caps not necessary, FB check the comments) for the link to my blog post with more info. \\n\\nThis is a discard recipe, but the chickpeas have to hydrate, hence the minimum 30 minute rest. I’ve tested up to four hours at room temp, or you can stick it in the fridge for 12-24 hours before baking! The only difference is a longer rest lends a more fluffy interior. \\n\\nRecipe:\\n•1/2 cup (65 g) chickpea flour\\n•1/2 cup (120 g) sourdough discard\\n•1/2 cup (120 g) water\\n•1 1/2 tbsp (18 g) olive oil, plus more for the skillet\\n•1/2 tsp (3 g) salt\\n\\nBlend, rest, preheat oven to 475 F with 10-inch cast iron skillet inside. Use a 12-inch skillet for thinner socca (and reduce baking time). When the skillet is hot, drizzle generously with olive oil, pour in the batter, and bake directly under the broiler for 12-14 minutes. For slightly better browning on top, you can broil for the last 2-4 minutes, but this is optional. Serve warm with another drizzle of olive oil, sprinkle of salt, and your favorite herbs.
